    <p>Hi, I'm James Kemp. I specialize in Database Management and Data Analysis. I enjoy working with data tables and figuring out the most efficient way to pull out and organize data. To me, it's just a big puzzle with multiple unique avenues to solve.</p>

      <h2>Future Goals</h2>
      <p>
        In the next 5 years, I'm hoping to get experience as a Database Manager in a company and working my way into Product Management; allowing me to use the Business Communications side of my major to help streamline the process of creating and pushing products out to the market. 
        Long term, I would like to work with A.I. to predict when and how shortages in the supply of goods might happen to proactively avoid those situations.
